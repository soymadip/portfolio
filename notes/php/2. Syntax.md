A PHP script is executed on the server, and the plain HTML result is sent back to the browser.

## Basic PHP Syntax

A PHP script can be placed anywhere in the document.

A PHP script starts with **`<?php`** and ends with **`?>`**

```php
<?php
// PHP code goes here
?>
```

A PHP file normally contains HTML tags, and some PHP scripting code.

Below, we have an example of a simple PHP file, with a PHP script that uses a built-in PHP function "echo" to output the text "Hello World!" on a web page:

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My first PHP page</h1>

<?php
echo "Hello World!";
?>

</body>
</html>
```

## Case Sensitivity

- _keywords_ (e.g. if, else, while, echo, etc.), classes, functions, and user-defined functions are _not case-sensitive_.

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
ECHO "Hello World!<br>";
echo "Hello World!<br>";
EcHo "Hello World!<br>";
?>

</body>
</html>
```

- _Variable_ names are case-sensitive.
```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
$color = "red";
echo "car is " . $color; // only this is valid.

echo "house is " . $COLOR;
echo "boat is " . $coLOR;
?>

</body>
</html>
```
