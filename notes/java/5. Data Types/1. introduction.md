# Java Data Types


## Syntax of declaring variable.
A [variable](https://www.w3schools.com/JAVA/java_variables.asp) in Java must be a specified data type:

- Example

```java
int myNum = 5;               // Integer (whole number)
float myFloatNum = 5.99f;    // Floating point number
char myLetter = 'D';         // Character
boolean myBool = true;       // Boolean
String myText = "Hello";     // String
```


<big> Data types are divided into two groups:-</big>
## Primitive Data Types

A primitive data type specifies the type of a variable and the kind of values it can hold.

There are eight primitive data types in Java:

| Data Type | Description                                                                       |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `byte`    | Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127                                             |
| `short`   | Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767                                       |
| `int`     | Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647                         |
| `long`    | Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |
| `float`   | Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits           |
| `double`  | Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 to 16 decimal digits         |
| `boolean` | Stores true or false values                                                       |
| `char`    | Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values                                  |

## Non-primitive data types 

Non-primitive data types are called **reference types** because they refer to objects.

<big>The main differences between primitive and non-primitive data types are:</big>

- Primitive types in Java are predefined and built into the language, while non-primitive types are created by the programmer (except for `String`).
- Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, whereas primitive types cannot.
- Primitive types start with a lowercase letter (like `int`), while non-primitive types typically starts with an uppercase letter (like `String`).
- Primitive types always hold a value, whereas non-primitive types can be `null`.

Examples of non-primitive types are [Strings](https://www.w3schools.com/JAVA/java_strings.asp), [Arrays](https://www.w3schools.com/JAVA/java_arrays.asp), [Classes](https://www.w3schools.com/JAVA/java_classes.asp) etc.
