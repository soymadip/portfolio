## Applications of DBMS

DBMS is widely used in various domains for managing and storing data efficiently. Some key applications include:

1. **Banking Sector** – To keep records of all customers.
2. **Universities** – To maintain records of students, teachers, etc.
3. **Airlines** – To manage reservation schedules and information.
4. **Credit Card Transactions** – To keep transaction records.
5. **Telecommunication** – For keeping records of monthly bills, maintaining balances, etc.

## Advantages of DBMS

DBMS provides several benefits, which are discussed below:-

### 1. Controlling Redundancy
- Duplicate data cannot be stored in various places in the same database.
- Reduces memory wastage by storing data efficiently.

### 2. Integrity Enforcement 
- Ensures data integrity so that incorrect information cannot be stored.
- Integrity constraints enforce data correctness, preventing the insertion of invalid data.

### 3. Avoiding Inconsistency
- Example: In a college system, if the General Office records indicate that **Roll No. 5 lives in Howrah**, but the library file states that **Roll No. 5 lives in Kolkata**, this creates inconsistency.
- DBMS prevents such conflicts by maintaining a single accurate record and allowing updates through queries.

### 4. Data Sharing
- Data is stored in a **centralized system**, allowing multiple users and programmers to access shared information.

### 5. Restricting Unauthorized Access
- DBMS provides security features to control user access and ensure that only authorized users can retrieve or modify data.
