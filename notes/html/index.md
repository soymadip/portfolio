## What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and design the structure of web pages. It provides the basic building blocks for web content by defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.

### Key Features of HTML:
- **Structure**: Defines the layout and organization of web content.
- **Semantics**: Uses tags to convey the meaning of content (e.g., `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`).
- **Media Integration**: Supports embedding images, videos, and audio.
- **Hyperlinks**: Enables navigation between web pages using links.

HTML is often used in combination with CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity) to create modern, dynamic websites.
