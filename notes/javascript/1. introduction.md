# JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for creating interactive web applications.  
It is a client-side scripting language but can also be used on the server-side (e.g., with Node.js).

## Key Features of JavaScript

- Dynamic & Interpreted – No need for compilation; runs directly in browsers.
- Event-Driven – Executes code in response to user actions (clicks, keypresses, etc.).
- Asynchronous & Non-Blocking – Uses callbacks, promises, and async/await for handling delays.
- Object-Oriented & Prototype-Based – Uses objects but follows a prototype-based inheritance model.
- Multi-Purpose – Works in browsers, servers (Node.js), and even mobile apps.
