Emmet is a web-developer’s toolkit that can greatly improve your HTML & CSS workflow. It is a plugin for many popular text editors which greatly improves HTML & CSS workflow.

Emmet allows you to write a line of simple code called an ‘abbreviation’, and then expand that code into a full block of HTML or CSS. This can save a lot of time when you’re writing HTML or CSS code.

### For easy elements multiply:

In HTML, you could write:

```html
ul>li*5
```
And Emmet will expand this into:
```html
<ul>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
</ul>
```

### Boiler Plate code:

By typing `!`  we can get boiler plate code for HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```
