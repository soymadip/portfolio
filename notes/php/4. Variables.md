# Variables
Variables are "containers" for storing information.

## Creating (Declaring) PHP Variables

In PHP, a _variable starts with_ the **$** sign, followed by the name of the variable:
```php
$x = 5;
$y = "John";
```

In the example above, the variable **`$x`** will hold the value 5, and the variable **`$y`** will hold the value "John".

:::note
When we assign a text value to a variable, put quotes around the value.
Unlike other programming languages, PHP has no command for declaring a variable. It is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

## Rules for PHP variables

1. A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable
2. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
3. A variable name cannot start with a number
4. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
5. Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)

## Variable Types

PHP has no command for declaring a variable, and the data type depends on the value of the variable.
```php
$x = 5;      // $x is an integer
$y = "John"; // $y is a string
echo $x;
echo $y;
```
