Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is widely used for building enterprise-scale applications, mobile applications, and web-based systems. Java's "write once, run anywhere" philosophy allows compiled code to run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

Key features of Java include:

-   **Platform Independence**: Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
-   **Object-Oriented**: Java follows the principles of object-oriented programming, making it modular, flexible, and extensible.
-   **Robust and Secure**: Java provides strong memory management, exception handling, and built-in security features.
-   **Rich API**: Java offers a vast library of classes and methods for various functionalities, including networking, data structures, and GUI development.

### Example: Hello World in Java

Here is a simple example of a Java program:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

This program defines a class `HelloWorld` with a `main` method, which is the entry point of any Java application. When executed, it prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

Java is widely adopted in industries such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce, making it a versatile and enduring choice for developers.
