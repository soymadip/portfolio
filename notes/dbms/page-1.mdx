## Characteristics of Database

The data in a database should have the following features:

1. **Shared** - The data in a database are shared among different users or programmers.
2. **Persistence** - Data in a database is stored permanently.
3. **Validity** - Data should be connected with respect to real-world entities, which have physical existence.
4. **Security** - Data should be protected from unauthorized access.
5. **Non-redundancy** - The same data item cannot exist in the same database, i.e., no two data items in a database should represent the same real-world entity.
6. **Independence** - Data at different levels should be independent of each other so that changes in one level should not affect the other level.
