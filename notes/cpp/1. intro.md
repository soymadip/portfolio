## What is C++?

C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language. It supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming paradigms, making it a versatile choice for a wide range of applications.

## Key Features of C++

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Enables encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Performance**: Offers low-level memory manipulation and high execution speed.
- **Standard Template Library (STL)**: Provides a collection of pre-built classes and functions for common data structures and algorithms.
- **Portability**: Can be compiled and run on various platforms with minimal changes.
- **Rich Library Support**: Includes extensive libraries for tasks like file handling, networking, and more.

C++ is widely used in system programming, game development, embedded systems, and real-time applications.
