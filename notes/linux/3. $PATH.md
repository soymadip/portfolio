## What is `PATH`?

`PATH` is an environment variable in Unix-like operating systems (including Linux and macOS) and Windows. It specifies a list of directories that the system searches for executable files when you type a command in the shell.

## Structure of `PATH`

- The `PATH` variable is a colon-separated list of directories.
- Each directory in the list is searched in order until an executable file matching the command name is found.

Example of a typical `PATH` value on a Unix-like system:

```bash
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/home/user/bin
```

## How `PATH` is Used

When you enter a command like `ls` or `python`, the shell looks in each directory listed in `PATH` for an executable file with that name. If it finds one, it runs the command. If not, it returns an error indicating the command was not found.

## Viewing and Modifying `PATH`

You can view the current `PATH` using the `echo` command:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

To add a directory to `PATH` in a bash shell, you can modify it like this:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/new/directory/path
```

## Example Use Case

Suppose you have a custom script located in `/home/user/scripts` and you want to be able to run it from anywhere without typing the full path. You would add `/home/user/scripts` to your `PATH`:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/home/user/scripts
```

To make this change permanent, you can add the above line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file.
