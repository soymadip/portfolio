## Characters
The `char` data type is used to store a **single** character. 
The character must be surrounded by single quotes, like 'A' or 'c':

- Example
```java
char myGrade = 'B';
```

**Tip:** A list of all ASCII values can be found in our [ASCII Table Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_html_ascii.asp).

## Strings

The `String` data type is used to store a sequence of characters (text). String values must be surrounded by double quotes:
[[_Data Types]]

- Example
```java
String greeting = "Hello World";
```


:::info title="Actually..."
A String in Java is __actually a non-primitive data type__, because it refers to an object. 
The String object has methods that are used to perform certain operations on strings

:::note
The String type is so much used and integrated in Java, that some call it __"the special ninth type"__.
