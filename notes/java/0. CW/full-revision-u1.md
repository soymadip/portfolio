# Unit 1 Full Revision

## Basics of Java, History, and Advantages

**Code Example:** N/A

## Java Virtual Machine & Byte Code

**Explanation:** JVM runs Java byte code on any platform. Byte code is the intermediate code between source code and machine code.

**Code Example:** N/A

## Java Environment Setup

**Explanation:** Setup includes JDK installation, configuring PATH variable, and verifying the setup with `java -version`.

**Code Example:** `java -version`

## Java Program Structure

**Explanation:** Every Java program has a `main` method. Syntax includes packages, classes, and methods.
