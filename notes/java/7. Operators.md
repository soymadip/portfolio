# Java Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

<big>Java divides the operators into the following groups:-</big>

-   Arithmetic operators
-   Assignment operators
-   Comparison operators
-   Logical operators
-   Bitwise operators

---

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.


<big>A list of all assignment operators:</big>

| __Operator__ | __Name__       | __Description__                        | __Example__ |
| :----------: | -------------- | -------------------------------------- | :---------: |
|      `+`     | Addition       | Adds together two values               |    `x + y`    |
|      `-`     | Subtraction    | Subtracts one value from another       |    `x - y`    |
|      `*`     | Multiplication | Multiplies two values                  |   `x * y`    |
|      `/`     | Division       | Divides one value by another           |    `x / y`    |
|      `%`     | Modulus        | Returns the division remainder         |    `x % y`    |
|     `++`     | Increment      | Increases the value of a variable by 1 |     `++x`     |
|     `--`     | Decrement      | Decreases the value of a variable by 1 |    `--x`     |

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

<big>A list of all assignment operators:</big>

| __Operator__ | __Example__ | __Same As__  |
| :----------: | ----------- | :-----------:|
|     `=`      |  `x = 5`    | `x = 5`      |
|     `+=`     |  `x += 3`   | `x = x + 3 ` |
|     `-=`     |  `x -= 3`   | `x = x - 3 ` |
|     `*=`     |  `x *= 3 `  | `x = x * 3`  |
|     `/=`     |  `x /= 3`   | `x = x / 3`  |
|     `%=`     |  `x %= 3`   | `x = x % 3`  |
|     `&=`     |  `x &= 3`   | `x = x & 3`  |
|     `\|=`    |  `x \|= 3 ` | `x = x \| 3` |
|     `^=`     |  `x ^= 3`   | `x = x ^ 3`  |
|     `>>=`    |  `x >>= 3 ` | `x = x >> 3` |
|     `<<=`    |  `x <<= 3 ` | `x = x << 3` |

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables). 

The return value of a comparison is either `true` or `false`. These values are known as _Boolean values_.

- In the following example, we use the **greater than** operator (`>`) to find out if 5 is greater than 3:-
```java
int x = 5;
int y = 3;

System.out.println(x > y); // returns true, because 5 is higher than 3
```

| __Operator__ | __Name__                 | __Example__ |
| :----------: | ------------------------ | :---------: |
|     `==`     | Equal to                 |   `x == y`  |
|     `!=`     | Not equal                |   `x != y`  |
|     `>`      | Greater than             |   `x > y`   |
|     `<`      | Less than                |   `x < y`   |
|     `>=`     | Greater than or equal to |   `x >= y`  |
|     `<=`     | Less than or equal to    |   `x <= y`  |

## Logical Operators

we can also test for `true` or `false` values with logical operators.

<big>Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values:-</big>

| __Operator__ | __Name__    | __Description__                                         | __Example__        |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `&&`         | Logical and | Returns true if both statements are true                | `x < 5 && x < 10`   |
| `\|\|`       | Logical or  | Returns true if one of the statements is true           | `x < 5 \|\| x < 4`  |
| `!`          | Logical not | Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true | `!(x < 5 && x < 10)` |
