# Comments 

A comment in PHP code is a line that is not executed as a part of the program. Its only purpose is to be read by someone who is looking at the code.

## Single Line Comments

Single line comments start with **`//`** or **`#`**.

```php
// Outputs a welcome message:
echo "Welcome Home!";
```


## Multi Line Comments 
Multi line comments start with **`/*`** & end with **`*/`**.

```php
/* This is a
multi-line comment */

```
