## Structure of a webpage

{/* Thanks Harry sir for this one. */}

In building a webpage, think of _HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as different parts of a car_. 

- HTML is like the car's skeleton, forming the basic structure and frame. 
- CSS adds the paint and finishing touches, making the car look appealing with color, style, and design. 
- JavaScript is similar to the engine and mechanical parts, infusing the car with functionality, movement, and interactive features. 

Similarly, when developing a website, HTML lays out the structure, CSS enhances its visual appeal, and JavaScript provides interactivity and dynamic content


## How do websites work?

When we want to access any information on the internet, we search for it using a web browser. The web browser retrieves the content from web servers, where it is stored in the form of HTML documents.

The text editor has the HTML code of a website. This website can now be viewed in a beautifully rendered format using a computer program known as a web browser.

- Web Browser(client) requests websites like [www.codewithharry.com](https://www.codewithharry.com/) from the web server.
- Web server in return sends HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to it.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are parsed by a web browser which is responsible for showing you a beautiful website.
